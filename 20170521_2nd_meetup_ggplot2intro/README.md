# Making fRiends with: ggplot2

Data + code for the [second RLadies Munich Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-munich/events/240663684/) on Wednesday 21st, 2017.

So excited to have the chance to experiment and play around with a visualization tool as cool and _actually_ not as scary to use as `ggplot2`! 

 [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/)'s `ggplot2` is a package that gets its name after the **Grammar of Graphics** (concept proposed by [Leland Wilkinson](https://www.amazon.com/Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448)), and was created as to offer a structured approach to data visualization.
